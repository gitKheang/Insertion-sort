# Insertion Sort Algorithm

This repository contains a Python implementation of the insertion sort algorithm. Insertion sort is a simple sorting algorithm that builds the final sorted array one item at a time. It's an in-place, comparison-based algorithm that works well for small datasets or partially sorted arrays.

## How Insertion Sort Works

Insertion sort works by considering one element at a time and inserting it into its correct position within the sorted portion of the array. Here's how the algorithm works:

1. Start with the second element (index 1) as the "key".
2. Compare the key with the previous elements in the sorted subarray.
3. Shift the elements larger than the key to the right to make space for the key.
4. Insert the key into the correct position in the sorted subarray.
5. Repeat the process for all elements in the array.

## Usage

To use the insertion sort implementation provided in this repository:

1. Clone the repository or download the `insertion_sort.py` file.

2. Import the `insertion_sort` function in your Python code:

   ```python
   from insertion_sort import insertion_sort
   ```

3. Create an array of elements that you want to sort:

   ```python
   arr = [12, 5, 9, 23, 1, 7]
   ```

4. Call the `insertion_sort` function and pass your array as an argument:

   ```python
   insertion_sort(arr)
   ```

5. After the function call, the `arr` will be sorted in ascending order.
